                <div>
                <p>An overwheling and familiar view of the internet. This is my take on the new norm and what is happening in the classroom of today. I use archival gifs, bright colors, and cocophonous surplus to evoke a feeling of early internet mania.</p>

            <h3 id="pvd" onclick="pvd()">PVD Tunnel</h3>
                <div>
                <p>
                A collaborative project investigating the physical site of Providenc Rhode Islands single abandoned train tunnel. I and my colleagues explored, investigated, and mapped the space ultimately resulting in a large poster like map detailing not only the history, and physical attributes, but the human experiences of the past present and future.

            <h3 id="quarentine" onclick="quarentine()">Quarentine Colaborative</h3>
                <div>
                <p> A collaborative publication reflecting on a semester of design work within a quarentined life. We showcased our recent projects using the vehicle of our desktop, having become our new workshop, and gallery in the age of COVID 19. Each page of this digital publication features a chatbox of our feedback, mimicking the would be gallery space dialogues.</p>

            <h3 id="oneFish" onclick="oneFish()">One Fish Two Fish</h3>
                <div>
                <p>A poster series, and eventual strange public outreach project collecting, at first, mens dating profiles (Tinder) specifically with fish in them. I sorted through over 5,000 profiles, each with up to 8 photos categorizing the presence of not only fish, but cows, horses, guns, swords, dogs, cats, and more. The posters were put up around Providence Rhode Islands thoroughfairs and messages from dozens of people eager to answer my fish-puns filled my voicemail. </p>
                </div>
            <h3 id="bait" onclick="bait()">Click Bait</h3>
                <div>
                <p>A short project aimed at getting as much web traffic as possible. Dora and I created bright and freindly characters and juxtoposed them next to jarring single word messages in order to cause distressful curiousity. Later I took these characters and animated them into gif form.</p>
                </div>
            <h3 id="faer" onclick="faer()">Faer</h3>
                <div>
                <p>A publication, and web project taking two seperate pieces of writting, The Legend of Cuchulainn and The Bassilisk by Paul Kingsnorth  and sets them within the same book, and website.  These two pieces differed greatly in content, one being a modern peice surrounding technology and the fears it brings, while the other is one of the oldest stories to come out of Ireland.</p>
                </div>
            <h3 id="riso" onclick="riso()">RISO Prints</h3>
                <div>
                <p>An experimental project both in visuals and tactility. Taking a variety of risograph prints, I perfect bound them into an aproximatly 300 page note/sketch book.</p>
                </div>
            <h3 id="abram" onclick="abram()">Abram & Felix</h3>
                <div>
                <p>A publication project featuring research and writing I conducted of two influencial designers from our past and present. Abram Games and Felix Pfaffli's work are juxtaposed and currated to fit within the system of the accordian book, while still speaking to thier individual styles and histories. </p>
